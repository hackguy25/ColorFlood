# ColorFlood
A C port of an Android game called Color Flood.

This program uses [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code), so it won't work properly in Windows' CMD. It has been tested on Ubuntu 15.10 32-bit system.

The program interacts with user in English, while the code itself (comments, variables...) is mostly Slovenian.

The header barve.h contains escape sequences saved as string constants, again some parts are Slovenian.
